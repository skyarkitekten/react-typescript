# Overview

This is a sample project that shows the scaffolding required to create React apps with TypeScipt. This skips the **create-react-app** tool in favor of a simple and pure setup.

## Project Setup

This project keeps all React TypeScript code in the `src` folder and publishes to the `dist` folder. It uses the Airbnb style guide combined with Prettier to enforce coding standards.

### Tools

- TypeScript
- React
